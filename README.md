# Hexaria

## What is it?
An interactive map with hexagon tiles akin to those in D&D games. Tiles hold information about the type of tiles they are, what kind of terrain they may have, what events have occurred on the tile and etc.

## What tech are we using?
Using a MERN stack along with Jest for snapshot testing and possibly Enzyme for React Compononent testing

## Why are you making this?
Why not? Wanna fight about it?

## How do we build it?
We would like to build this the TDD way as it would be best practice but we may follow a spike then DDT XD.
Also making sure we document any discoveries along the way. This readme is gonna be YUGE!! (yea, right)
